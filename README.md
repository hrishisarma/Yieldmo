# Yieldmo

The questions have been answered as follows -

Algorithm question 1 -

Segment.java

Algoritm question 2 -

I have done through with 2 approaches-
  a) using Sets - YieldmoChecker3.java
  b) only Lists - YieldmoChecker2.java
  
I have attached a sample file check.txt which I used for my testing, the file location needs to be changed accordingly inside the java programs to be run fully.


SQL question -

Both the SQL questions have been done in the file SQL.txt
